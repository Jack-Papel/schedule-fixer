# Schedule Fixer
Since 2020, CSH's schedule maker has exported its calendars incorrectly. Since this issue has not been resolved in so long, I've decided to create a python script to fix them.

This project is a work in progress, so if you spot any bugs, please open an issue. I'll be sure to get around to it in under two years ðŸ˜‚

In the future I might add a web interface if interest is suffiecient, so you don't have to download an EXE (which Windows does not trust at all).
