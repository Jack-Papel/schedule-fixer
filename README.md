# Schedule Fixer
Since 2020, CSH's schedule maker has exported its calendars incorrectly. Since this issue has not been resolved in so long, I've decided to create a python script to fix them.

This project is not yet complete, but when it is, I hope to make an executable version for Windows, Mac, and Linux. (For those that don't have python installed)
